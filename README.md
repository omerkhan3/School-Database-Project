# School-Database-Project
Created using C++. By: Omer Khan

This project basically creates the backbone for a school database with students and employees.  This program is mainly just menu driven.  When run, the user will be given 5 options: Add records, list records, modify records, delete records, 
or exit the program.  The user can select the corresponding number with each command run it.  When adding records, user will be asked to add relevant information and it
wil be added to the text file "Database."  When user lists records, they can choose to list either sorted based on occupation or in actual order.  For modify records and 
delete records, the way this program works is that it rewrites the information to a temporary text document.  It will either exclude the selected line (delete), or write 
it differently.
